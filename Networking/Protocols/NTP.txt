NTP: Network Time Protocol

- Uses UDP, port123 

- purpose to synchronize the clocks of computers and network devices

Criticl for:
- Security (Kerberos, Cerificats, Logs)
- Complience and auditing

How it works:
- Client sends request with timestamp T1
- Server records T2 (receive time) and send time T3
- Clinet notes T4 (response arrival)
- Calculates offset and round-trip delay to adjuct clock

Accuracy:
- Public internet = miliseconds
- LAN = Better than 1 ms

Other version:
- SNTP (Simple NTP) lightweighrt version

NTP is vulnerable to:
- Spoofing / Time Injection
- DoS attacks
- Configuration tampering

Best Practices:
- Multiple NTP servers for redundancy
- Enable authentication
- Access to trusted clients only
- Monitor NTP trfic for anomaly
