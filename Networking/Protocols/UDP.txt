UDP (User Datagramm Protocol

- Transport Layer (Layer 4) protocol
- Connectionless = does not establish a session before sending data.
  Independently sends packets (datagramm) without guaranteeing delivery. This makes UDP fast and lightweight, ideal for real-time applications.
  Supports Broadcast and Multicast: Efficient to send data to multiple recipients


- Undeliable: no guarantee of delivery or order
- No congestion control: Can flood networks
- No error recovery
