ARP: Address Resolution Protocoll

- uses data-link layer

- IPv4 based only 
- the main purpose is to map IP address (Layer3) to a MAC address (Layer2)

IP Address = Logical identifier (like an apartment number)
MAC Address = Physical address (more like a street address)

ARP Cache = a local ARP table for IP to MAC mapping

How it works:
Machine A wants to communicate with Machine B, Machine A already knows the IP of Machine B. To communicate Machine A must lear MAC address of Machine B.
- Sends an ARP request:
  Who has IP 192.168.1.11?
- Receive ARP reply (unicast):
  192.168.1.11 is at CC:DD:EE:EE    the target responds

Security ISSUES:
- ARP has no authentication:
  ARP Spoofin/Poisoning = Attackers can inject false IP-MAC mapping.
- Mitigation(kockázatcsökkentés) = Dynamic ARP Inspection(DAI), Static ARP entries, VLAN segmentation

Types of ARP:
Categories that indicates how they have been impemented and the usecase they have in different scenarios.
- Dynamic ARP    = Commonly used in  LANs. Auto created by ARP protocol during normal network communication.
- Static ARP     = Network admins use this when they want to manualy set IP-MAC adress mappings. They do not expire or get affected by updating processes by dynamic ARP.
- Proxy ARP      = Enables a Layer3 device, like routers to respond ARP requests on behalf of another devices on different subnet.
- Gratuitous ARP = proactive broadcast by a device to prevent outdated entries. has two purpose: Update APR caches, Checking duplicates.

       PROs:                CONs:
network efficiency    |   Vulnerable
                       
Auto update to adapt  |   Network
     changes          |  congestion


ARP spoofing:
Man in the middle attack, attackers intercept communication between network devices.
Attackers who has access to the network can send false APR messages, false IP - MAC mappings. With it, attackers can misdirect data.

IPv6 uses NDP = Neighbour Discovery Protocol
