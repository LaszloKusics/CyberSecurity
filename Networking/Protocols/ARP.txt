ARP: Address Resolution Protocoll

- IPv4 based only 
- the main purpose is to map IP address (Layer3) to a MAC address (Layer2)

IP Address = Logical identifier (like a house number)
MAC Address = Physical address (more like a street address)

ARP Cache = a local ARP table for IP to MAC mapping

How it works:

- Sends an ARP request:
  Who has IP 192.168.1.11?
- Receive ARP reply (unicast):
  192.168.1.11 is at CC:DD:EE:EE    the target responds

Security ISSUES:
- ARP has no authentication:
  ARP Spoofin/Poisoning = Attackers can inject false IP-MAC mapping.
- Mitigation(kockázatcsökkentés) = Dynamic ARP Inspection(DAI), Static ARP entries, VLAN segmentation

Additional:
IPv6 uses NDP = Neighbour Discovery Protocol
